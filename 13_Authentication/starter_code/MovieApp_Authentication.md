##Adding Authentication


We are going to add authentication to MovieApp using Devise.

Here is the functionality we need to add this lesson (start with the MovieApp code provided in the starter code folder.)

* Visitors (not logged in) get the generic funcationality of MovieApp (see all movies, their genres and actors)

* When Users sign in they have a link available to them to view the list of movies they have watched

Note: A visitor is anyone who comes to your site, they are not logged in users. A logged in user is also a visitor.


BONUS:

* Allow users to add movies to their list of watched movies. You could do by displaying a list of movies (say on the homepage, like we already do!) with a link attached to each one saying "add to watched list." It would also be nice to let users "remove from watched list" the movies that they have already seen.
