##Lesson 14: Getting Started



###Learning Objectives

This lesson, students will:

*	Create user stories to help them define functionality.

*	Create wire frames of views based on user stories to better conceptualize what they want their app to accomplish.

*	Diagram database schemas continued.

###Homework

Due Lesson 15: Milestone 2

*	At least 5 User Stories.
*	Diagram of database schema (models, attributes for those models, associations).
*	Continue Wireframing, have an idea of how all parts of your application will function.

This milestone is a great way for you to identify major hurdles in a project before you begin to code.
